# SiFive Trace Performance Library

### Introduction

The SiFive Trace Performance Library is intended as an example of how timestamped performance data from on-processor performance counters can be collected and written into the trace buffer using the ITC trace mechanism. The SiFive trace decoder can extract the performance information and write it to textual performance data files for further processing using such tools as Freedom Studio/Trace Compass.

### Description

Some SiFive processors have both on-processor trace capabilities and performance counters. The SiFive Trace Performance Library provides a mechanism to choose which of the performance counters to write to the trace buffer and when to write it. Performance counter information is written to the trace buffer using the ITC trace mechanism as data acquisition messages. The  performance library supports either manual instrumenting the program under trace with library function calls to collect the performance data and write it to the trace buffer, or using a timer based ISR to collect the performance data and write it to the trace buffer, or recording performance data at the entry and exit of functions.

For details on what trace capabilities and performance counter support the processor design being used supports, reference the documentation for the particular processor implementation being traced.

The Sifive Trace Decoder can extract performance data written with the Sifive Trace Performance Library. Extracted performance and address information is written to text files which can then be processed with Freedom Studio/Trace Compass. For information on using the trace decoder to manually extract the performance information and the format of the extracted information, reference the SiFive Trace Decoder Performance Counter document. To view the information in Freedom Studio with Trace Compass, see the Freedom Studio documentation.

The performance library supports collecting performance data for both single core processors and multiple cores processors. Currently it does not support multi-cluster (more than one funnel), but that support would be easy to add.

### API

The SiFive perf library provides the following routines for initializing and collecting performance data:

```
int perfInit(int num_cores,int num_funnels)
int perfManualInit(uint32_t counterMask,int itcChannel,int stopOnWrap,int markerCnt)
int perfTimerISRInitint interval,uint32_t counterMask,int itcChannel,int stopOnWrap,int markerCnt)
int perfFuncEntryExitInit(uint32_t counterMask,int itcChannel,int stopOnWrap,int markerCnt)
int perfWriteCntrs()
int perfTraceOn()
int perfTraceOff()
int perfResetCntrs(uint32_t cntrMask)

```

Below, each of the routines are described.

```
int perfInit(int num_cores,int num_funnels)
```

`PerfInit()` initializes variables used by the sifivPerf routines. PerfInit must be called before any other sifive_perf routines, including other init routines. It should only be called once. If tracing multiple cores, only one core should call perfInit().

Arguments:

`int num_cores:` The number of cores for the processor being traced.

`int num_funnels:` The number of trace funnels for the processor being traced. In the current implementation, more than one funnel is not currently supported (multi-cluster).

Returns 0 on success, otherwise error.

```
int perfManualInit(uint32_t counterMask,int itcChannel,int stopOnWrap,int markerCnt)
```

`PerfManualInit()` should be used when manually instrumenting the program (adding explicit calls to perfWriteCntrs() where you would like to record the performance counters). It will program the trace engine and do any needed setup. `PerfManualInit()` should be called after `perfInit()` and before any performance data is collected.

The trace engine will be set up with trace mode `teInstruction = 0` (no instruction trace) and `teInstrumentation = 1` (generate ITC message for all itStimulus registers). Also, timestamps will be on. note that if instruction trace and itc instrumentation is enabled, the number of itc (data acquisition) messages that will fit in the buffer will be greatly reduced because of the presence of BTM or HTM messages in the buffer.

If tracing multiple cores, each core to trace needs to call `perfManualInit()`. If only tracing a single core, only that core needs to call `perfManualInit()`.

Arguments:

`uint32_t counterMask:` There are up to 32 HPM performance counters that can be recorded, although actual implementations may be less. Counters are identified by a number 0 - 31, and the bit position in the mask specifies the counter number (e.g. bit 3 is counter 3). Bits that are set in the mask will be recorded. The program counter is always recorded, as are timestamps. Each core being traced can have a different `counterMask`.

`int itcChannel:` Which ITC channel to write the performance data out to. The channel number can be 0 - 31. Channel 6 is the commonly used channel for performance data, and the default channel for the trace decoder (but it can be overridden). All cores being traced should use the same channel. Each core will write to its own set of ITC stimulus registers, so each core's data can be identified in the trace (the trace decoder will supply the source core information in the decoded output).

`int stopOnWrap:` This is a boolean that specifies if the teStopOnWrap bit should be set in the teControl register. Typically, the stop-on-wrap bit should be set. If it is not, the trace decoder may not be able to successfully decode the trace because the trace may never contain an uncompressed time stamp which is needed to decoder timestamps correctly.

`int markerCnt:` Specifies how often to write a marker into the trace message stream. If 0, an initial marker will be written only on the first call to `perfWriteCntrs()`, and never again. If greater than 0, specifies how many times `perfWriteCntrs()` will be called before inserting a marker message (for example, 100 would write a marker message every 100 times the `perfWriteCntrs()` is invoked). An initial marker message is always written before the very first time performance data is written to the trace buffer. The marker ensures the trace decoder can synchronize the expected performance data item with what is in the buffer, and also informs the trace decoder what performance data is being written. The marker contains a header value that can be identified as a marker, the `coutnerMask`, and the performance counter programming for all HPM performance counters 3 and greater. Performance counters 0 - 2 are fixed function and not programmable, so no definition is needed.

Returns 0 on success, otherwise error.

```
int perfTimerISRInit(int interval,uint32_t counterMask,int itcChannel,int stopOnWrap,int markerCnt)
```

The `perfTimerISRInit()` function performs the following tasks: Programs a timer based ISR that will be invoked every interval microseconds and write the current execution address and selected HPM counters to the trace buffer using ITC writes for the selected core. The trace engine is programmed for ITC instrumentation and no instruction trace.

The trace engine will be set up with trace mode `teInstruction = 0` (no instruction trace) and `teInstrumentation = 1` (generate ITC message for all itStimulus registers). Also, timestamps will be on. note that if instruction trace and itc instrumentation is enabled, the number of itc (data acquisition) messages that will fit in the buffer will be greatly reduced because of the presence of BTM or HTM messages in the buffer.

When using timer based performance tracing, a stack size of at least 800 bytes is needed. Check the linker script for your project, and if the stack size is less than 800 bytes, adjust it accordingly. The default stack size for a project is typically 400 bytes. If odd behavior is observed, such as program crashes, try increasing the stack size further.

If tracing multiple cores, each core to be traced must call `perfTimerISRInit()`.

After calling `perfTimerISRInit()`, the counters are running and the ISR is being called, but nothing will be recorded in the trace buffer until `perfTraceOn()` is called.

Arguments:

`int interval:` The period in microseconds the timer ISR will be called at. If less than 100, 100 will be used.

`uint32_t counterMask:` a 32 bit mask that specifies which HPM counters to read and record in the trace buffer using ITC writes. The address of where the timer interrupt occured is also always written.

`int itcChannel:` Specifies which ITC stimulus register to write the performance data to. Can be 0 - 31. Channel 6 is the normal performance data channel.

`int stopOnWrap:` If non-zero, will set the stop-on-wrap bit in the teControl register, otherwise it will be cleared. If stop-on-wrap is cleared, the trace decoder may not be able to decode the trace correctly because buffer wrap may overwrite any timestamp synchronization messages (ICT Control message).

`int markerCnt:` Specifies how often to write a marker into the trace message stream. If 0, an initial marker will be written only the first time the ISR is invoked, and never again. If greater than 0, specifies how many times the ISR will write performance data to the trace buffer before inserting a marker message (for example, 100 would write a marker message every 100 times the timer ISR is invoked). An initial marker message is always written before the very first time performance data is written to the trace buffer. The marker ensures the trace decoder can synchronize the expected performance data item with what is in the buffer, and also informs the trace decoder what performance data is being written. The marker contains an initial value that can be identified as a marker, the coutnerMask, and the performance counter programming for all HPM performance counters 3 and greater. Performance counters 0, 1, and 2 are fixed function and not programmable.

Returns 0 on success, otherwise error.

```
int perfWriteCntrs()
```

Used for manual instrumentation of the program. Calling `perfWriteCntr()` performs the same function as the timer ISR, but is explicitly called in the program when manually instrumenting for performance data collection. The `perfInit()` and `perfManualInit()` functions must be called before the first call to `perfWriteCntrs()`. When called, performance data will be written for the calling core. the perormance data specified in the call to perfManualInit() for that core will be written.

After calling `perfManualInit()`, the counters are enabled and trace is enabled, but calls to perWriteCntrs() will not write data to the trace buffer until `perfTraceOn()` is called.

Returns 0 on success, otherwise error.

```
int perfFuncEntryExitInit(uint32_t counterMask,int itcChannel,int stopOnWrap,int markerCnt)
```

Initializes the system for collecting performance information on the entry and exit to functions. On entry to a function, the information collected is the beginning address of the function being entered (called), the address of where it was called from, and any performance counters specified by the counterMask argument. The same data is recored on function exit; the beginning address of the function being exited is recored and not the address of the return.

Using function level performance data collection requires compiling the code of interest with the -finstrument-functions switch to insert special calls at the entry and exit of functions. Versions of these special entry/exit functions are provided by the SiFive Perf Library. Function level instrumention using the -finstrument-functions has been verified to work with both gcc and with clang (LLVM). You will need to modify your projects Makefiles and add the -finstrument-functions swith where appropriate. Also, normally you do not want to compile any of the metal library routines with the -finstrument-functions switch because the entry/exit functions provided in the SiFive Perf Library make use of some of them, which could cause infinite recursion.

If the processor has multiple cores, all cores should call this init function. All cores will execute code that call functions that have been instrumented with the function entry/exit routines. If not all cores have called the `perfFuncEntryExitInit()` function, you will see unexpected results and program crashes.

Returns 0 on success, otherwise error.

```
int perfTraceOn()
```

Enables writing performance information to the trace buffer. By default after calling the init routines, capturing performance data is disabled. After calling `perTraceOn()`, performance data will be written to the trace buffer.

The `perfTraceOn()` function enables capturing trace data for all cores that have been initialized to capture performance data. If using function entry/exit performance data tracing, it will be on for all cores.

Returns 0 on success, otherwise error.

```
int perfTraceOff()
```

Disbles writing performance information to the trace buffer. Performance counters will still be running, but no data will be written to the trace buffer.

The `perfTraceOff()` function disables capturing trace data for all cores. A call to `perfTraceOn()` will resume capturing trace data.

Returns 0 on success, otherwise error.

```
int perfResetCntrs(uint32_t cntrMask)
```

The `perfResetCntrs()` function will reset all the counters specified by the cntrMask argument for the calling cores. Counters specified by the cntrMask will be reset to 0. If there are multiple cores, only the calling core's counters will be reset.

Returns 0 on success, otherwise error.

### SiFive Perf Library Usage

Whether using manual performance data collection, a timer ISR to collect performance data, or function entry/exit performance data collection, some modification of the program under trace will need to be done. All methods are outlined below. As a general rule, only one type of performance data collection may be supported at a time. For example, you cannot do both function entry/exit and timer ISR based data collection. This is also true for manual performance data collection.

If using any HPM counters other than 0, 1, or 2 to collect performance data, it is the programmers responsibility to add code to program the desired counters correctly using the metal HPM functions. Counter 0, 1, and 2 are fixed function and cannot be configured differently.

Manual Performance Data Collection:

Prior to collecting performance data, a call to `perfInit(int numCore, int numFunnels)` must be made. The first argument specifies the number of cores in the processor, and numFunnels specifies the number of funnels. NumFunnels should be 0 if there are no funnels. If multi-core, only one core should call `perfInit()`.

After calling `perfInif()`, `perfManualInit(uint32_t counterMask,int itcChannel,int stopOnWrap,int markerCnt)` should be called. Each core that will be collecting performance data should call `perfManualInit()` before any performance data is collected. After calling `perfManualINit()`, `perfTraceOn()` will need to be collected to enable writing performance data to the trace buffer.

Add calls to your code for `perfWriteCntrs()` wherever you want performance data to be collected and written to the trace buffer.

Timer ISR Performance Data Collection:

To enable a timer ISR to collect performance data, First call `perfInit(int numCore, int numFunnels)`, similar to manual performance data collection. If multi-core, only one core should `call perfInit()`. Next, add a call to `perfTimerISRInit(int interval,uint32_t counterMask,int itcChannel,int stopOnWrap,int markerCnt)`. After the call to `perfTimerISRInit()`, the timer is running but data will not be written to the trace buffer until `perfTraceOn()` is called. Each core wishing to collect performance data for should call `perfTimerISRInit()`. The `perfTraceOn()` function should not be called until all cores that are going to call `perfTimerISRInit()` have done so.

Function Entry/Exit Performance Data Collection:

To enable collecting performance data at the entry/exit of functions, first add code so a single core calls `perfInit()`. Next, every core should call `perfFuncEntryExitInit(uint32_t counterMask,int itcChannel,int stopOnWrap,int markerCnt)`. When doing function entry/exit performance data collection, all cores will be calling code that has been instrumented by the compiler to call special functions at the entry and exit of functions. After calling `perfFuncEntryExitInit()`, performance data will not be collected until a call to `perfTraceOn()`.

Function entry/exit level tracing requires compiling the desired code to trace with the -finstrument-functions switch. This will add special code to the entry and exit of functions to call the functions `__cyg_profile_func_exit()` and `__cyg_profile_funct_enter()` in the SiFive perf library. Makefile modifications will be required. It is advised to not compile the metal functions with the -finstrument-functions switch because the __cyg_profile_func entry and exit functions make use of some of the metal functions, which would cause infinite recursion. To explicitly force a function to not be compiled with the function entry/exit instruementation, you can annotate a function declaration with the no_instruemnt_function attribute (see the sifive_perf.c file for examples).

### Performance Data Format

All performance data is written to the trace buffer using ITC stimulus register writes creating data acquisition messages in the trace buffer. Only the itc channel specified in the initialization functions is used for all writes. All data is in binary.

The captured performance trace is a combination of header information and performance trace data. The header contains information on the type of performance trace (function entry-exit information or periodic and manual information). The header also contains information on the HPM counters being measured (which ones, and how they are configured). The header is called the marker, which also identifies the start of the trace.

Marker Message Format:

Marker messages provide information to the trace decoder on what HPM counters are being recorded and the programming of the HPM counters, as well as the type of performance trace. Every marker messages begins with a full 32 bit data acquisition messages with the data value `0x70657266` (which is ('p'<<24)|('e'<<16)|('r'<<8)|('f'<<0)) for manual and timer based writes. If doing function entry/exit instrumentation, the marker message will begin with a `0x66756e63` (which is ('f'<<24|('u'<<16)|('n'<<8)|('c')<<0). The beginning value allows the trace decoder to identify a marker in the performance data stream, and the type of tracing being performed. It is possible an actual counter value will coincide with the marker header value, which would cause decoder confusion, but unlikely This possible confusion could be removed if it was gauantted there would only be one marker message at the beginning of the trace. Currently, it is possible to have multiple markers throuout the trace.

Following the marker identification word will be a second 32 bit data acquisition message that contains the counter mask. Non-zero bits in the mask give which HPM counters will be recorded by their position in the mask.

The examples below show the format for a function instrumentation marker written into the trace buffer. It assumes ITC channel 6 for performance data, and an HPM counter mask of 0x0000000c (counters 2 and 3 being collected). Counter 2 is programmed for instructions retired, and counter 3 is programmed for a RAW event counter.

The marker and counter mask would be:

| Message Number | ID Tag | Value | Description |
| :------------: | :----: | :---: | :---------- |
| #1 | 0x00000018 | 0x66756e6e | Marker identification header |
| #2 | 0x00000018 | 0x0000000c | HPM counter mask |

Following the counter mask will be a series of data acquisition messages with the programming of any HPM counters that are being recorded (as indicated by the previous counter mask). HPM performance counters event information data is borrowed from the RICS-V Supervisor Binary Interface Specification, Version 1.0, which uses Type, Code, and Event Data. Each HPM counter will also have a counter info field wich give the size in bits of the counter and the HPM CSR address of the counter. Type is a 32 bit data acqusition message with the type of the event. Legal values for traces are 0 (Hardware General Events), 1 (Hardware Cache Events), and 2 (Hardware Raw Events). For event types of 0 and 1, the next field is a 32 bit Code field. The meanding of the Code field varries by Event Type, and can be found in the RISC-V SBI Specification. Event types of 2 do not have a Code field, but instead have a 64 bit Event Data field (two data acquisition writes; the first is the lower 32 bits, the second is the upper 32 bits). The 64 bit Event Data field contains the raw programming of the HPM event selectors, and is only used for event type 2 (Event Hardware Raw Events).

For all message type, the next field is the counter info field, in a single 32 bit data acquistion message. The format of the counter info field si the same as the lower 32 bits of the counter_info field in the RISC-V SBI specification. Bits 11:0 contain the 12 bit CSR number. Bits 17:12 contain the most significant bit number of the counter. For example, if the counter is 32 bits wide, it would be 31 (for bits 0 - 31).

An example of a counter definiation for counter definition for counter 2 would be:

| #3 | 0x00000018 | 0x00000000 | Type = 0. Hardware General Event |
| #4 | 0x00000018 | 0x00000002 | Code = 2. Harware General Event SBI_PMU_SW_INSTRUCTIONS |
| #5 | 0x00000018 | 0x0003fc02 | Counter Info: CSR = 0xc02, width = 64 bits (63..0) |

And for counter 3, programmed as a Raw Event would be:

| #6 | 0x00000018 | 0x00000002 | Type = 2. Hardware Raw Event |
| #7 | 0x00000018 | 0x00000000 | Event Data: bits 31..0 |
| #8 | 0x00000018 | 0x00000002 | Event Data: bits 63..32 |

The type, code, event_data, and counter_info fields are repeated for all counters being recorded as indicated by the counter mask.

For description of the raw event data, see the manual for the processor being used, under the Event Selector Encodings section.

Performance Data Format:

For timer ISR performance tracing or manual performance tracing, every time performance data is recorded in the trace buffer, the first thing written is the address of where in the binary being traced execution was as when either the ISR was invoked or a manual write to record perfdata was called. On processors with 32 bit address space, a single full 32 bit data acquisition message will be written. On systems with more than 32 bits of address space, if the upper 32 bits of the address are 0, only a single 32 bit data acquisition message will be written. If the upper 32 bits are not 0, bit 0 in the lower 32 bits will be set and written using a full 32 bit data acquisition message. Next, the upper 32 bits will be written using a second 32 bit data acquisition message. Valid addresses for the processor will always have bit 0 clear, so setting bit 0 to signal a second 32 bits of address follows can be used when the address is greater than 32 bits. When the trace decoder sees bit 0 set in the first address message, it knows there is a second address following for the upper 32 bits.

For function entry/exit performance tracing, the format is similar, but has some differences. For function entry, the first thing will be a single byte data acquisition message with the value 'C'. Single byte data acquisition messages can be identified by an ID tag with the lower two bits set. Following the 'C' will be two addresses, using the same 32 or 64 bit address as described above for the timer ISR and manual messages. The first address is the beginning address of the funciton being entered, and the second address is the address of where it was called from. For function exit messages, there will be no single byte data acquisition messsage, just the two addresses. For function exit, the first address will be the beginning address for the function being exited, and the second address will be where it was called from.

For timer ISR, manaual, and function entry/exit performance tracing, following the address(es), the selected HPM counters will be written from the lower numbers to the higher numbered (the order is deterministic). To reduce the size of the performance data write to the trace buffer and increase the number of performance data measurements that will fit in the trace buffer, the number of writes to the trace buffer for each performance counter is variable. HPM performance counters can be up to 64 bits each. The actual size is implementation dependent. Currently, the SiFive performance library will do either a single 32 bit write for each performance counter (the lower 32 bits), or a 48 bit write (more than 32 bits).  If the actual value of the performance counter fits in 32 bits (the upper 32 bits are 0), a single 32 bit data acquisition message will be written into the trace buffer. If the upper 32 bits are not 0, the lower 32 bits will first be written as a full ITC stimulus write and the next 16 bits (bits 32 - 47) will be written as a 16 bit ITC stimulus write. This allows the trace decoder to deterministically parse the data acquisition stream and determine if 32 or 48 bits were written for a performance counter (by the presence of 16 bit data acquisition messages). 48 bits per counter is likely adequate, but if this restriction proves problematic, the format will be modified to provide additional bits.

Below is an example of the format for performance counter data in the trace buffer. It assumes ITC channel 6 for performance data, more than 32 bits of address space, and an HPM counter mask of 0x00000003. In this example, HPM counter 0 has more than 32 bits of significant data and counter 1 has 32 bits or less.

| Message Number | ID Tag | Value | Description |
| :------------: | :----: | :---: | :---------- |
| #1 | 0x00000018 | 0x800022c6 | Lower 32 bits of address. Bit 0 is clear which indicates the address fits in 32 bits |
| #2 | 0x00000018 | 0x000029e3 | Lower 32 bits of count 0 |
| #3 | 0x0000001a | 0x1234 | Next 16 bits of counter 0. The ID tag of 0x1a instead of 0x18 indicates this is a 16 bit write and not 32 |
| #4 | 0x00000018 | 0x12345678 | Lower 32 bits of counter 1. Upper 32 bats are all 0, so no additional write for counter 1 |

Support for programming what the HPM counters 3 and up actually count can be done using the HPM Metal routines, and is not part of this SiFive performance library.

### Current Limitations

Freedom Studio (and perhaps other debuggers) alter the trace encoder and funnel registers on break/resume. It is recommended you do not set any breakpoints between the calls to the performance library init routines until after you have executed the code you wish to collect performance data for.

Stack size needs to be at least 800 bytes. Check the linker script to make sure. If odd behavior is seen, try increasing the stack size further. The amount needed will depend on the actual program being traced.

The current SiFive performance library has the following known limitations:

Counter definitions as part of the perf markers are only the lower 32 bits. The limitation is created by the metal library routine `metal_hpm_get_event()`, and will be fixed in the future.

Multicore support is functional, but mutli-cluster is currently not supported (more than one funnel).

Only processors with support for the ICT Control Message CKSRC = 0, CKDF = 0 are known to work for collecting decodable traces. This is because the Control 0, 0 message is used to insert an uncompressed timestamp into the trace buffer using an ICT message. Without an initial uncompressed timestamp, timestamp values cannot be correctly decoded. Processors with support for event trace should have the needed ICT Control Message.

The SRAM trace buffers on processors have limited size and may restrict the amount of data that can be collected. If available, the SBA sink may be used to collect larger amounts of performance data. Using an SBA sink will require modifications to the init routines in the SiFive perf library for programming the trace engine.

### Example Program

The program below shows how to use the timer ISR performance data collection. Create a project in Freedom Studio and replace the main program with the one below. Make sure traceBaseAddress is set correctly for the processor being used. Also, add sifive_trace.h, sifive_perf.h, and sifive_perf.c to the project. The program below requires a stack size of 800, set in the linker script.
